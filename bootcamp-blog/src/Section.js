                <p> In the fall of 2018, I began my 6 month journey taking a web development bootcamp at a local university. I began the program with mixed feels of excitement and of fear knowing how demanding the class would be as it would be ontop of my regular 9-5 job. I had taken a few introductory courses on Java and C++ in college as part of my major in Information Technology but it had been years since I had written any actual code. Luckily I had a co-worker who took a similar style class a few months prior so I was able to ask him a bunch of questions before signing up for the class.
